# DataScience-Toolkit

This repository will serve as a collection of notes and examples for the most essential models, methods, and techniques in the data scientist's toolkit.

The project will be a long-running work-in-progress, but I will continue to update it as I cover new material and study new concepts. All material is only meant to serve as a personal reference and compilation of available tools, thus the goal is to keep examples short and sweet without too much oversimplification.

## Road-Map

The following are some of the essentials that I have already learned and plan to add here as well as some ideas for future work:

### Predictive Analytics

- Linear Regression
  - Simple
  - Ridge/LASSO
- Logistic Regression
  - Binomial
  - Polytomous
- Nonlinear regressions
- Simple Neural Networks
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Survival Analysis

### Data Mining Techniques

- K-Means
- Gaussian Mixtures
- Hierarchical Clustering
- KNN
- Matrix Factorization and DEDICOM
- Recommendation Systems
- Life-Time Value Analysis
- General Retention Models
- Migration Model
- PCA
- Latent Factor Analysis
- Anomaly Detection
  - Simple Statistical Measures
  - Cluster-Based Solutions
  - Local Outlier Factor
- Kalman Filters
